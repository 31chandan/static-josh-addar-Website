                        <p class="sec3Section4Title">JOSH STATES "THE BALL IS ROLLING" ON THE NEW SINGLE </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para1">An email went out to everyone on the mailing list this morning and
                            Josh stated the work has officially begun on the debut single "About A Girl". You can read
                            that email for yourself below.</p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para2">Hey ya’ll, </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para3">Josh here. Just wanted to touch base with everyone and bring you up
                            to speed with the new single. Joe and I had a skype meeting with part of the team from
                            Nashville yesterday to get things rolling on the song. I feel we walked away with a real
                            feeling of the finished product. The song carries such a drive. We’re also going to add some
                            rootsie elements as well. (Picture Keith Urban early 2000’s vibe… but current lol) We’re
                            working with a ton of talented people on this project. To start with, the writers on this
                            song alone, Josh Martin who was featured in Rolling Stone just this week for his new single
                            “Cold Again”, Kylie Sackley who is nominated for songwriter of the year this year for the
                            Canadian CMA’s, and singer/songwriter Andy Skib who is the lead singer of the rock band
                            Midwest Kings and spent 2009 touring with American Idols David Cook. Not to mention all the
                            musicians involved. There is a lot of talent on board and Joe and I are honestly pinching
                            ourselves to have the opportunity to represent their work. Also, there a lot of belief from
                            the team this song could be TOP 40 so we have a great group now beginning to reach out to
                            their contacts to prepare it for Country Music Radio. So, it’s an understatement for me to
                            say we are so excited to bring this to you. </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para4">This song was legitimately pitched to us by mistake. We were only
                            listening to hear the quality of the song and I just lyrically fell in love with the song
                            itself. I felt like it was a song that could really highlight who we are as artist. There’s
                            so much pressure to release a song especially a debut single because your first single
                            really sets the tone for who you are as artist. So, we have really tried to be extremely
                            selective when it comes to this first song. However, the moment we heard the demo of About A
                            Girl it was almost like I knew instantly that this was it. I felt it in my gut. </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para5">The guitar tracks and scratch vocals are being worked on as we
                            speak. They’re supposed to send them to me for approval by this evening. Anyway, we love
                            being able to communicate with you all so email us back! We love to hear from y’all. </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section5Para6">Y’all just keep praying for us as things are coming together. Start
                            getting excited and building hype about the release. Tell everyone you know! We can’t wait
                            to see where this journey takes us.</p>

                        <p class="sec3Section6Para1">The stage was set and the stars were shining Friday evening for a
                            power packed night full of fun times, good food and good music at Ole Red Gatlinburg.</p>
                        <p class="sec3Section6Para2">The house was packed Friday night when J&J Holler took the stage at
                            8 PM to play their second live concert for Ole Red fans and county music seekers. They
                            played an hour set before announcing country music recording artist and Grand Ole Opry
                            member Mark Wills to take the stage.</p>
                        <p class="sec3Section6Para3">The "Don't Laugh at Me" singer played an hour set and then J&J

                        <p class="sec3Section6Para4">The guys had an opportunity to hang out with Mark backstage and
                            said it was an awesome experience.</p>
                        <p class="sec3Section6Para5">"I grew up singing his songs. "19 Something" was my favorite songs
                            to perform as a kid. So this night has been so nostalgic for me. Then to just sit down and
                            have a conversation with him and he be so kind and down to earth really makes me believe in
                            country music. Then to see him perform songs like "Jacobs Ladder" and "I Do"... I just felt
                            like I was a 10 year old kid again. I still cant believe its real. This has truly been a
                            night i'll remember for the rest of my life." -Josh </p>
                        <p class="sec3Section6Para6">"Mark was such a down to earth guy! To have the opportunity to sit
                            stage side and hear him sing one of his hit songs will always be a great memory. It was such
                            a great evening." -Joe</p>

                            establishment and hopefully coming back in the future." He added.</p>
